# `get_next_line`, everything is a file

Welcome to my `get_next_line` project for 42 Berlin!

Here you can find my code and a brief explanation of how I wrote this program. I don't want to spoil anyone's experience at 42, so I'm not gonna detail the ins and outs. I suggest you don't copy the code but actually think of your own implementation.

## My approach
My approach is based on [Oceano's video](https://youtu.be/8E9siq7apUU) and it involves the use of linked lists. I want to advise that this is not the simplest way of solving this problem. Probably going the traditional way with arrays is faster. But I still advise you to consider linked lists as it will give you a good foundation for the next projects. It is only a bit harder to do but much more rewarding.

## Warning
If you go the linked list way, beware of memory in case of wrong inputs. `get_next_line` tester will fail in some particular cases. If you run into this kind of problem, take a look at my pinned comment in Oceano's video where I shared my solution.

But know this: *do not solely rely on automatic tests!* Use your own, use Valgrind, and learn the necessary flags. Testers will only help you so much. Beware in case of still reachable leaks, they must be justified.

Of course, feel free to contact me if you need help.
